TASK 2:Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner). In this section we will see how the K-Means algorithm for machine learning can be used for prediction.We will be predicting the the optimum number of clusters and their visual representation.

ALGORITHM USED - K-Means Algorithm
K-Means It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.

WORKFLOW behind Implemention of K-Means Clustering

1. Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

2. Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

3. Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

4. Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

5. Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

6. If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

7. The model is ready.
